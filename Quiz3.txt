--1. Create a tablespace with name 'quiz_noche' and two datafiles. Each datafile of 10Mb.

CREATE TABLESPACE quiz_noche
DATAFILE 'E:\Dora Cristina\ITM\ADMINISTRACION BD\EXAM\quiz_noche1.dbf' size 10M, 
         'E:\Dora Cristina\ITM\ADMINISTRACION BD\EXAM\quiz_noche2.dbf' size 10M 
ONLINE;   

--2. Create a profile with idle time of 5 minutes, the name of the profile should be 'estudiante'

CREATE PROFILE estudiante 	LIMIT
PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME		5;

--3. Create an user named "user1" with password "user1".

CREATE USER user1
	IDENTIFIED BY user1 
	DEFAULT TABLESPACE quiz_noche	
	QUOTA UNLIMITED ON quiz_noche 
	PROFILE estudiante;	

GRANT connect to user1;
		
GRANT CREATE TABLE to user1;

--4. Create an user named "user2" with password "user2"

CREATE USER user2
	IDENTIFIED BY user2
	DEFAULT TABLESPACE quiz_noche	
	QUOTA UNLIMITED ON quiz_noche 
	PROFILE estudiante;

	GRANT CONNECT to user2;

REVOKE CREATE ANY TABLE FROM user2;


--PART II

--1. With the user1 create the next table (DON'T CHANGE THE NAME OF THE TABLE NOR COLUMNS:

create table attacks (
id INT,
url VARCHAR(2048),
ip_address VARCHAR(20),
number_of_attacks INT,
time_of_last_attack TIMESTAMP
);

---1. Count the urls which have been attacked and have the protocol 'http'

SELECT (Number_Of_Attacks) FROM ATTACKS;

---2. List the records where the URL attacked matches with google (it does not matter if it is google.co.jp, google.es, google.pt, etc) order by number of attacks descendant

SELECT URL FROM ATTACKS WHERE NUMBER_OF_ATTACKS > 0 ORDER BY NUMBER_OF_ATTACKS DESC;

--3. List the ip addresses and the time of the last attack if the attack has been produced this year (2018) (Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/a/30071091)

SELECT Time_Of_Last_Attack, MAX(date) FROM ATTACKS GROUP BY Time_Of_Last_Attack;
